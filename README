yCMS - yellow Content Management System

A custom CMS for kaiwulf.dev

Why yellow? Why not?

Currently a CMS for a personal site but plan on expanding it in the future.

To run on command line in debug mode, use ```run.sh debug```, otherwise run as plain ```run.sh```. Untested on Windows and MacOS.

To initialize database, use ```flask --app py3 init-db```
