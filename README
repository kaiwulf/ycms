yCMS - yellow Content Management System

A custom CMS for kaiwulf.dev

Why yellow? Why not?

Currently a CMS for a personal site but plan on expanding it in the future.

For now, to run, type in `cat run` in linux command line. Untested on Windows and MacOS.

To initialize database, use `flask --app py3 init-db`
